# Unifi Tools

Chris Lomont, 2022

Some C# code that lets you grab snapshots, video, and make timelapses by pulling Unifi Protect video through their undocumented API

## Usage

Edit the main file, `Program.cs`, to do the tasks you want. You need to put in your login and password to the code to access Unifi Protect.

Put `ffmpeg.exe`in the directory with the executable.

This is very rough - I only needed it for one timelapse (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RZzOI5P7T4) I wanted. 

No support :) You're on your own.
